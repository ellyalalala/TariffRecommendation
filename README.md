# TariffRecommendation

We need to build a model for the classification task that will select the appropriate tariff.
You have at your disposal data on the behavior of customers who have already switched to these tariffs (from the draft course "Statistical Data Analysis"). You need to build a model for the classification problem that will select the appropriate rate. There is no need for data preprocessing - you have already done it.
Build a model with the highest possible accuracy value. To pass the project successfully, you need to bring the percentage of correct answers to at least 0.75. Check the accuracy on a test sample yourself.
